Webmentions are an exciting standard which help enable the IndieWeb. We can own our own content, hosted on our own domains, without sacrificing social connection and replies with other people!

In this talk, I discuss what webmentions are and how to implement them. The code is based on an Eleventy site, but the concepts should be applicable to any site.

The latest slides can be accessed at [projects.sia.codes/webmentions-eleventy-talk/](https://projects.sia.codes/webmentions-eleventy-talk/#/). To advance the slides, use `n` for next and `p` for previous. The right arrow jumps to the next section (and left for previous section). Up and down to advance through slides within a section.

Stay tuned here for updates and a possible recording!
