<h2>Testimonials</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sia’s workshop gave me the guidance and tools I needed to finally begin diagnosing real performance problems in my web applications. Not only did her course shed light on how to solve the issues I knew I had, but it also exposed problems I hadn't discovered yet. Whether you’ve got an application that’s not performing well or if you just want to have a better grasp of the performance tools available, Sia’s Measuring Web Performance workshop is well worth your time.</p>
  <p>--Aundra Miller, Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.learning.com/">Learning.com</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sia was my instructor at Tech Talent South. Thanks to her I've been able to move forward in my career as a Software Developer. Her knowledge and endless patience for our questions created a foundation that I've been building on ever since. She is a fantastic teacher."</p>
