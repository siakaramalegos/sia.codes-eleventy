I'm a freelance web developer and web performance engineer. Most recently, I was working at Shopify, helping merchants make their online stores faster. I also took those learnings back to the platform to make wider changes such as implementing the `section.index` and default lazy loading features in Liquid. I built out a large part of [performance.shopify.com](https://performance.shopify.com/) and its blog with the help of my team.

I'm also a co-organizer for the [Eleventy Meetup](https://eleventymeetup.netlify.app/) and a Google Developer Expert in Web Technologies. I recently joined the [W3C](https://www.w3.org/) web performance working group as well and am enjoying participating more in the platform standards. As a developer, I love building things that help make people's lives easier. Check out [Coder Ipsum](https://coder-ipsum.tech/) for a fun developer-inspired ipsum text generator.

As a person, I also love making developer's lives easier through teaching, speaking, and mentoring. You can find more information about me and the topics I speak about on my [speaking page](/speaking). I talk about front-end topics such as web performance, JavaScript, and the Jamstack.
