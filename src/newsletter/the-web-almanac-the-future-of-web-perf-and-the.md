Hi folks,

It's been over 3 months since the hurricane and my last newsletter to you. That finally changes today! It's amazing what stable shelter will do for you. Let's jump right in.

## Web Almanac 2021: Performance

I'm excited that we finally launched the 2021 Web Almanac! I wrote the [Performance chapter](https://almanac.httparchive.org/en/2021/performance). It was a lot of work during a tough time in my life, so I'm particularly proud that we made it across the finish line. This year, we had access to ranking data which opened up some new insights. Check it out for insights into the Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) plus TTFB and FCP. I included a deep-dive into the LCP element and also some CMS data associations which were enlightening. Check out all the chapters - there is so much great content!

## WebPageTest Livestream

Last week, I chatted with Tim Kadlec and Henri Helvetica on the [WebPageTest live stream](https://www.twitch.tv/webpagetest) about the Web Almanac and our findings. It was fun! You can check out the [recording here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1228728950).

## The Future of Web Performance

I recently updated my talk for the Future of Front End Performance. It was nice to reflect on what's new and coming soon in the world of web performance, like image codecs, priority hints, native lazy-loading, new metrics, and more. What new features and tools are you looking forward to?
