## New post: a retro on my old Twitter series
I published a new post, [#30DaysOfWebPerf: The Pros and Cons of a Twitter series](https://sia.codes/posts/30-days-web-perf/). It's been a long time coming since I did the series at the end of 2019. Recently I've been contemplating other ideas for delivering serial content in smaller chunks.

## I just enabled AVIF on Cloudinary... Wow
You can already use AVIF on Cloudinary with the picture tag - see [How to Adopt AVIF for Images With Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/blog/how_to_adopt_avif_for_images_with_cloudinary).

That's cool but I'm lazy. I use a plain img tag and use Cloudinary's [f_auto](https://cloudinary.com/documentation/image_transformations#automatic_format_selection_f_auto) flag to automatically choose the best format. It's great for reducing all your markup. So I signed up for the AVIF f_auto beta (see article on how). It's amazing though there are a few things to be aware of. I started to write them here, then realized this was getting lengthy and I should turn it into a blog post - stay tuned (hopefully) next week!

## What are your favorite niche or obscure web performance tools?

Join the conversation on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/TheGreenGreek/status/1417237545230950410)! Not on Twitter? Reply to me with your favorites and why. I might turn this into another blog post but it could be huge lol.

Have a nice week, y'all!
