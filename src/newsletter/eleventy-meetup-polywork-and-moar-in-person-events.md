## New Eleventy Meetup

I'm super excited to announce a brand new virtrual meetup I'm co-organizing with [Vince Falconi](https://twitter.com/vincefalconi) and [Stephanie Eckles](https://twitter.com/5t3ph) on Eleventy!

I was on a focus group for GDE's who have also run DevFests when I realized that while the pandemic made in-person and regional meetup attendance go down, it actually increased reach for meetups focused on a particular technology. Thus blossomed my Eleventy meetup idea.

How has the pandemic affected your tech community, both good and bad?

Check out [our website](https://11tymeetup.dev/) to see our events, sign up for emails, or subscribe to our RSS feed! You can also follow our shiny, new [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/EleventyMeetup).

## Does Polywork make me look cool?

I am still trying to figure out this latest career/social media app. If you're a fan, check out my [timeline](https://timeline.sia.codes/). Also, let me know your profile so I can follow you! It seems to be great for folks like me that don't seem to stick to one lane while driving our careers. It's also giving me ideas for yet another website redesign. What are your thoughts on it?

## New article update coming soon

One thing I love about the [GDE program](https://developers.google.com/community/experts) is the web performance sub-grouping. Occasionally we get to chat with the internal teams about the latest news and thinking. One deep-dive we talked about was web fonts, so stay tuned for an updated post on web fonts!

## MOAR IN-PERSON EVENTS!

Last week I told you about my performance workshop at [Connect.Tech](https://2021.connect.tech/) in November. I'll also be giving it and more talks at both [UberConf](https://uberconf.com/) in Denver, CO in October and [The Progressive Web Experience](https://progressivewebexperience.io/) in Clearwater, FL in December.

Love, peace, and hair grease!
