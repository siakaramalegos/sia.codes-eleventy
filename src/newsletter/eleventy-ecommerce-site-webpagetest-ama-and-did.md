## Digital e-commerce talk for the Eleventy Meetup

I'm excited to share a new talk and project with you! I'm building out a shop for my arts/crafts website for digital downloads. One of my hobbies was to design crochet patterns and create coloring pages. I have shops on Etsy but always wanted to self-host one as well (IndieWeb, amiright?).

The talk is on February 10 at 1pm Eastern - you can get all the details on the [Eleventy Meetup site](https://11tymeetup.dev/).

It's a sneak peek into a longer video or live stream series that I'm working on with my friend [Matt Ling](https://twitter.com/mattling_dev) from Stripe. So stay tuned for that info too!

## The Web Almanac AMA presented by WebPageTest

Last week I was on a panel of Web Almanac contributors where we answered a lot of questions about the process and the findings from last year. Check out the recording now on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vREyU2-M4Eo).

## New massive hobby

Since the pandemic began, my Lego sets seem to be proliferating. :sweat_smile: I thought I would regret some of it but the modular buildings just keep getting cooler and cooler so now I'm going to go ahead and build a Lego city!!!! If this sounds like fun, follow my new [Lego-insta](https://www.instagram.com/siabuildslego/) or check out my [new website](https://siabuildslego.com/) I just built in a day. Buh-bye, money!

Until next time, my friends!
