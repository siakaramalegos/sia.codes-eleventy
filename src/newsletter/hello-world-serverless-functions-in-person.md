title: Hello, world! Serverless functions, in-person workshops, and image resolution

In case you didn't have enough newsletters in your inbox, I've decided to add another to the crowd. :) I plan to keep these short and sweet because who has time to really read all that email???

## New Content

I often do talks for newer developers, and learning what **serverless** is like and what it is capable of is something I wished I had seen when I was in my bootcamping days. I wrote up the live demo as a tutorial to help folks try it out on their own:

[Going Intergalactic with Serverless Functions on Netlify](https://sia.codes/posts/serverless-functions-netlify/) - Get started going serverless with Netlify functions and Netlify-CLI for keeping secrets secret

## Events

Next week I'll be giving the above-mentioned **talk on serverless functions** in Netlify to [Social Hackers Academy](https://socialhackersacademy.org/), the first tech education school in Athens for vulnerable groups. The event is virtual on June 30, 2021, and you can the event details and zoom link on the [event page](https://socialhackersacademy.org/event/sha-talks-intro-to-serverless-functions-using-netlify/).

I'll be teaching a **[Web Performance Workshop](https://github.com/siakaramalegos/perf_workshop#abstract)** at **[Connect.Tech](https://2021.connect.tech/)** this year! It's live and in person in **Atlanta**, November 8-10, 2021. [Register now](https://reg.connectevents.io/ConnectEvents/CT2021/) for the early bird discount.

## Cool Stuff by Other Folks

I love the **Jamstack**, and am looking forward to [Celebrating 2 years: Jamstack Growing Up, Intro to GROQ and Automation w/ GitHub Actions](https://www.meetup.com/JAMstack-Toronto/events/278868956) the Jamstack Toronto virtual meetup on 6/29.

This week I did a **deep-dive on images**. The [Serving sharp images to high density screens](https://jakearchibald.com/2021/serving-sharp-images-to-high-density-screens/) post by Jake Archibald was helpful as I  refactored an image element to a picture tag with DPR media queries!

Older but related to the above, with many phones now with 3x screens, how high of a DPR should we actually target? These posts are helpful:

- [Capping image fidelity on ultra-high resolution devices](https://blog.twitter.com/engineering/en_us/topics/infrastructure/2019/capping-image-fidelity-on-ultra-high-resolution-devices) by Nolan O'Brien on the Twitter blog
- [Visual acuity and device-pixel-ratio](https://observablehq.com/@eeeps/visual-acuity-and-device-pixel-ratio) by Eric Portis

Also, [Yoav Weiss](https://twitter.com/yoavweiss) wants to get an origin trial going soon for [setting a max DPR cap on images](https://chromium-review.googlesource.com/c/chromium/src/+/2395619).

Finally, Andy Bell's [Tips and notes about freelancing](https://piccalil.li/blog/tips-and-notes-about-freelancing/) is great evergreen advice. Freelance opportunities indeed seem to be growing right now.

That's all folks!
