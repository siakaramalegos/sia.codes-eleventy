## The resurgence of RSS
With the downfall of Twitter has come a resurgence of the IndieWeb and RSS. My blog has an [RSS feed](https://sia.codes/feed/feed.xml) as well as [this newsletter](https://sia.codes/feed/news.xml).  If you're a fan of 11ty, the [RSS plugin](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/plugins/rss/) makes it easier to create a feed of your posts. Does your site have an RSS feed? If so, reply with the link so I can subscribe to it!

## Performance.now() Amsterdam
It was wonderful to travel and hang out with people again at [performance.now()](https://perfnow.nl/). This was the first time I got to meet web perf people in person and had a blast. I also met my team, and my boss gave me this cute [double decker bus](https://www.instagram.com/p/Ckqqu-YrLGR/) for my LEGO city. I call it the cat bus since it's not minifig scale. üòÄüêà

The conference was amazing, and I highly recommend it.

## Mastodon thoughts
I joined Mastodon and have been pleasantly surprised by the high level of engagement within our tech community. I have fewer followers but many more relevant conversations happening all while dialing down the rage cycle. You can find me at [@sia@front-end.social](https://front-end.social/@sia).

## From the Shopify Performance Blog
We officially launched our new web performance-focused blog at Shopify, [performance.shopify.com](https://performance.shopify.com/blogs/blog/lazy-load-images-for-performance). Let me know what you think! We plan to build out a lot more content for theme developers and merchants to better understand how they can improve.

Continuing from the last newsletter, the next post I wrote there was about [using Liquid to lazy-load images](https://performance.shopify.com/blogs/blog/lazy-load-images-for-performance). Of course, the standard caveat is to never lazy load your LCP or important content above the fold.
