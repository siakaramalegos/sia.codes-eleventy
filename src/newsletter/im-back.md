title: I'm baaack! Social media, content updates, Connect.Tech, and art

Hey folks, it's been a while! I missed you during my whirlwind 2 years at Shopify. Now I'm back to (hopefully paid) freelancing and (sadly unpaid) content creation.

I'm getting back into the swing of things, starting with this newsletter...

## The state of social media
I have learned the unfortunate news that [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karamalegos/) is apparently hopping for professional social media. Luckily [Mastodon](https://front-end.social/@sia) is still a solid place for my fellow nerd engagement. I'm also on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/sia.codes) but use it mostly for ðŸ’© posts (so beware). Anyway, this means **I need to learn how to use LinkedIn better - if you have tips, please share!**

## My web perf content from the last two years
One of my accomplishments at Shopify was to build our web performance blog at [performance.shopify.com](https://performance.shopify.com/). I built the site and wrote several blog posts. The [Optimizing Performance](https://performance.shopify.com/pages/techniques-for-optimizing-web-performance) page organizes the posts by Core Web Vitals metric. Much of the content still applies to the general web, so check it out! Some of **my favorite posts** are:

- [Debugging common causes for slow loading in Shopify Liquid storefronts](https://performance.shopify.com/blogs/blog/debugging-common-causes-for-slow-loading-in-shopify-liquid-storefronts)
- [How to optimize Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS) on Shopify sites](https://performance.shopify.com/blogs/blog/how-to-optimize-cumulative-layout-shift-cls-on-shopify-sites)
- [Announcing new Liquid features for better web performance](https://performance.shopify.com/blogs/blog/announcing-new-liquid-features-for-better-web-performance) - this one is a favorite because it's a feature I built in the platform to help drive significant improvements in LCP

## Returning to Connect.Tech in Atlanta
I'm excited that I'll be at [Connect.Tech](https://2024.connect.tech/) again this year after a 2 year hiatus. I'm teaching a workshop on web performance as well as speaking about lab testing vs real user monitoring but with a clickbaity title. **Use the code SEEMESPEAK to get $100 off the ticket price!**

## /Offline
One of my favorite newsletter-like blogs is written by [Melanie Richards](https://melanie-richards.com/). She brings her whole self to her blog, and I especially enjoy her creative side. So I've decided to bring in a few non-tech notes from my offline life here.

- I'm re-reading [Big Magic](https://bookshop.org/a/105516/9781594634727) by Elizabeth Gilbert in my constant quest for trying to make my art more of a habit. I was blown away the first time I read it. It's still an inspiring read, though I think it is better suited to when you're struggling to inspire yourself to get started.
- I recently finished reading [Nature's Best Hope: A New Approach to Conservation That Starts in Your Yard](https://bookshop.org/a/105516/9781604699005) by Doug Tallamy. It's a great introduction to the whys of native gardening. It can be a bit preachy, but if you can look beyond that, understanding the ecological science can be inspiring for your own native gardening journey. If you want more of a how and are in North America, then [Prairie Up: An Introduction to Natural Garden Design](https://bookshop.org/a/105516/9780252086779) by Benjamin Vogt is excellent.
- Sign-ups for the winter classes at my local arts council are this Friday. I've been attending the open figure drawing sessions, and I think I'll sign up again. It seems many people prefer static long poses, but my preference is shorter, dynamic, active poses. I have not found a better option yet though.

What are your favorite offline pursuits? How do you maintain those hobbies while they compete with everything that distracts us so easily?
