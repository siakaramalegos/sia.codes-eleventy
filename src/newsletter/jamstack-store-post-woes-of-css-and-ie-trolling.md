## Serverless Ecommerce Store content - now all in one place!

Matthew Ling and I did a series of livestreams where we build out a digital download shop using Eleventy, Stripe, Netlify, and more. First it was a meetup talk, then the livestreams, then 3 companion articles. Now you can finally find them all in one place in my new blog post!

## The Woes of CSS

I found an interesting z-index in the wild and a lot of people found it funny:

It was funny because it was so relatable. The planets must have been aligned because the day before I found it, I attended the [CSS Cafe](https://www.meetup.com/CSS-Cafe/) meetup where Josh Comeau gave this excellent talk on the hidden/secret fundamentals of CSS which covered this exact issue. He used some great analogies for this and other CSS concepts that will finally stick with me. I hope. ðŸ¤ž

## Trolling IE still gets engagement

And it's probably time to consider that making your site more accessible could lead to more conversions than making it compatible with IE.

## Other great stuff

- [Cassidy](https://twitter.com/cassidoo) shared a weird neat trick on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cassidoo/status/1525949077250269185) to see a calendar in your terminal with the `cal` command, and to see the full year you can do `cal 2022`
- New developments in Core Web Vitals from Google I/O - [thread](https://twitter.com/philwalton/status/1524782413741576192) by Phil Walton
- [Making the worldâ€™s fastest website, and other mistakes](https://dev.to/tigt/making-the-worlds-fastest-website-and-other-mistakes-56na) is an entertaining read about the realness of trying to make a website faster. I particularly liked the second post in the series about streaming HTML and look forward to more from Taylor Hunt.
