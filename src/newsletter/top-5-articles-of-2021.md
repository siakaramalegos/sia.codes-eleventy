Hey folks! I'm busy working on a new contract which is exciting, but it's left less time for making new content sadly. In the meantime, here are my top 5 posts of 2021 based on analytics. Enjoy!

Coming in at **#5**, we have an intro to understanding how to use and design data in [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/), [Architecting data in Eleventy](https://sia.codes/posts/architecting-data-in-eleventy/). It walks through setting and using data in the static site generator Eleventy so that you can better understand the possibilities for architecting your web app.

Rolling in at **#4** is another post albeit newer about Eleventy, [Itsiest, Bitsiest Eleventy Tutorial](https://sia.codes/posts/itsiest-bitsiest-eleventy-tutorial/). You might have heard a lot of buzz about Eleventy but maybe are a bit intimidated by some of the resources. Want just a small taste of it? Here's my quick, scaled-down tutorial.

Now we're getting into the heavy-hitters. Rounding out **#3** in the top 5 is my long-form post on render-blocking resources. I wrote this because existing articles at the time seemed confusing for most folks, and it's often a big contributor to slow sites: [How to Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources: a Deep Dive](https://sia.codes/posts/render-blocking-resources/).

Coming in at **#2** is an explainer for Lighthouse Treemap - my favorite new performance tool in 2021: [Explore JavaScript Dependencies With Lighthouse Treemap](https://sia.codes/posts/lighthouse-treemap/).

And now, the moment you've all been waiting for...

My **top post** for the year is on a multi-year winning streak. I regularly keep it updated because of this: [Making Google Fonts Faster](https://sia.codes/posts/making-google-fonts-faster/).
