## New post on web performance!

I'm excited that I just published [How to Eliminate Render-Blocking Resources: a Deep Dive](https://sia.codes/posts/render-blocking-resources/). It's a longer-form article that is written more for beginners to web performance. I spent a lot of time trying to depict the critical render path as diagrams - let me know what you think!

## WebPageTest Twitch

[WebPageTest](https://webpagetest.org/) has a new [Twitch stream](https://www.twitch.tv/webpagetest)! If you ever wanted to get better at performance profiling, [Tim Kadlec](https://twitter.com/tkadlec) is great to watch. He's also going live on the [Learn With Jason](https://www.twitch.tv/jlengstorf) livestream today!

## Blog email course

Because one 7-day email course wasn't enough for me, I also signed up for Monica Lent's [Blogging for Devs](https://bloggingfordevs.com/) one. The tagline is \"Learn to grow your blog as a developer without an existing audience\". I liked it as an overview for improving your blogging capabilities with some SEO tips too. I recommend it! (It's also free.)

After a while, crocodiles. Especially [Croki](https://www.marvel.com/articles/tv-shows/glorious-alligator-loki). ♥️
