Happy Monday folks!

## New Post! Lighthouse Treemap

I just put the finishing touches on [Explore JavaScript Dependencies With Lighthouse Treemap](https://sia.codes/posts/lighthouse-treemap/): Discover all JavaScript downloaded and used/unused for a site in a handy data visualization with Lighthouse Treemap.

Let me know what you think!

## Coming soon: Performance tools survey results

I was curious which measurement tools other performance engineers were using, so I created a survey. It's been fun exploring the data, and I can't wait to finish and publish the new post.

## Scott Jehl's performance workshop is now free

I haven't tried it out yet, but I'm sure it has lots of great content. Here's the announcement [tweet](https://twitter.com/scottjehl/status/1420406821026729987), and here's the direct link to the website with the [free course](https://scottjehl.com/lfwp/). Have you taken it? Let me know how you liked it!

Catch you on the flip side!
