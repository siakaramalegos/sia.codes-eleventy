<h2>Testimonials</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sia has definitely mastered the art of keeping a listener engaged. Her humor and ability to communicate technical
  concepts at the same time is an amazing talent. All information was presented well and provided a long list of notes to
  take back to my company and coworkers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sia’s workshop gave me the guidance and tools I needed to finally begin diagnosing real performance problems in my web applications. Not only did her course shed light on how to solve the issues I knew I had, but it also exposed problems I hadn't discovered yet. Whether you’ve got an application that’s not performing well or if you just want to have a better grasp of the performance tools available, Sia’s Measuring Web Performance workshop is well worth your time.</p>
