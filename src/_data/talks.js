Going serverless means having no server to manage while also having the ability to scale infinitely. In this talk, we'll start with a basic, static Eleventy website then build in dynamic features like form handling and secure API access using serverless functions. We'll use the Netlify CLI to set up our dev environment and deploy to production on Netlify."
